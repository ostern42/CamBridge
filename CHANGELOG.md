## Version History Summary
- Total development time: ~44.7 hours over 2.8 days
- Night shifts: DICOM (01:17), GUI (02:22)
- Version duplicates: v0.0.2 (78 sec), v0.4.0 (9 hours)
- Missing versions: DICOM commit, v0.3.3 (was in old CHANGELOG but not in git)

## Lessons Learned
- Always increment version numbers, even for small changes
- Use "babysteps" versioning (v0.0.1 â v0.0.2 â v0.0.3)
- Check git history before committing to avoid duplicates
- Night shift commits need extra attention to versioning
