## [0.7.13] - 2025-06-14 (Session 63)
Fixed 🐛

CRITICAL: Fixed JSON deserialization error in InitializePrimaryConfig
Invalid OutputOrganization enum values in default config generation ("PatientName" → "ByPatientAndDate")
Service port property name (ApiPort → ListenPort)
Incomplete pipeline configuration in default settings
InitializePrimaryConfig() was literally cut off mid-function!

Changed

Default OutputOrganization from invalid "PatientName" to valid "ByPatientAndDate"
Mapping rules now include both targetTag and dicomTag properties for compatibility
Complete rewrite of InitializePrimaryConfig() with all required fields

Added

Emergency fix scripts for JSON repair
Debug tools for configuration validation
VOGON EXIT documentation procedure

Technical Details

Valid OutputOrganization values: None, ByPatient, ByDate, ByPatientAndDate
Config MUST have CamBridge wrapper: { "CamBridge": { ... } }
Port MUST be 5111 everywhere

## [0.7.12] - 2025-06-14 Session 61

### 🚨 Sources First Implementation + Dashboard Fix!

### Fixed
- **Port Mismatch** - HttpApiService now uses correct port 5111 (was 5050)
  - Config UI couldn't connect to service on wrong port
  - Simple one-line fix with massive impact!
- **InitializePrimaryConfig** - Now creates proper V2 format with "CamBridge" wrapper
  - Was creating invalid config without wrapper section
  - ConfigurationService expects "CamBridge" section
  - Complete implementation with all default settings
- **DashboardViewModel** - Version header updated to 0.7.12
  - Old version was hiding in plain sight (0.7.1)
  - Shows importance of systematic version updates
- **Namespace Issues** - Fixed references in multiple files
  - `CamBridge.Core.Services` → `CamBridge.Core`
  - `PipelineConfigModel` → `PipelineConfiguration`
- **ViewModels** - Made `partial` for MVVM Toolkit compatibility

### Added
- **Sources First Principle** - Critical development rule established
  - ALWAYS check Projektwissen for existing code
  - NEVER recreate from memory
  - Version increments are MANDATORY for deployments
- **Get-WisdomSources.ps1** - Revolutionary source code collector
  - Collects ALL sources into project-specific files
  - Designed for Projektwissen integration (Oliver's genius idea!)
  - Token-efficient access to complete codebase
  - Prevents duplicate file creation mistakes

### Changed
- **HttpApiService** - BaseAddress updated to http://localhost:5111/
- **ConfigurationPaths.InitializePrimaryConfig()** - Complete V2 implementation
- **DashboardViewModel** - Version updated to 0.7.12 in header
- **App.xaml.cs** - Calls InitializePrimaryConfig on startup
- **Development workflow** - Sources MUST be checked first

### Technical Details
- **Root Causes:** 4 critical issues found
  1. Wrong API port in HttpApiService (5050 vs 5111)
  2. InitializePrimaryConfig creating wrong format
  3. Outdated version headers
  4. Missing namespace references
- **Solution Complexity:** 4 simple fixes = working dashboard!
- **Testing:** Clean config, restart service, verify pipelines
- **Deployment:** Version 0.7.12 creates new deployment folder

### Developer Notes
- Session 61: Dashboard fix after systematic debugging
- CRITICAL LESSON: Sources First means CHECK FIRST, not recreate!
- Version increments are NOT optional - they control deployment
- Small details (ports, versions) have massive impact
- Projektwissen integration changes everything

### Migration Steps
1. Delete old config: `Remove-Item "$env:ProgramData\CamBridge\appsettings.json"`
2. Deploy version 0.7.12 (creates new folder)
3. Start service with `1[TAB]`
4. Open Config Tool with `2[TAB]`
5. Dashboard should show pipelines!

  - Core: FilePattern, ProcessingOptions, different structure
- **Root Cause:** Config UI missing ConfigurationPaths.InitializePrimaryConfig()

### Designed
- **Unified V2 JSON Format** with "CamBridge" wrapper section
- **ConfigurationPaths everywhere** - single source of truth
- **Consistent property names** across all components
- **Development overrides** that only change values, not structure
- **ParseServiceFormat removal** - no more workarounds needed

### Planned Implementation
1. Add ConfigurationPaths to Config UI startup (App.xaml.cs)
2. Migrate JSON files to unified V2 format
3. Update Service to use "CamBridge" section
4. Remove ParseServiceFormat workaround
5. Test Debug vs Release consistency

### Code Changes Prepared
- **App.xaml.cs** - Added ConfigurationPaths.InitializePrimaryConfig()
- **appsettings.json** - Unified V2 format with proper structure

- **ServiceCollectionExtensions** - Ready for "CamBridge" section

### Developer Notes
- Session 60: Deep configuration analysis complete
- Oliver: "ein nachvollziehbarer klarer, vernünftiger weg für die zukunft"
- Solution: Unity through ConfigurationPaths and consistent format
- KISS: One config format for all modes and components
- Next: Implement and test with Tab-Complete system

### Technical Debt Identified
- Multiple incompatible config formats
- Missing centralized path management

- Night shifts: DICOM (01:17), GUI (02:22)
- Version duplicates: v0.0.2 (78 sec), v0.4.0 (9 hours)
- Missing versions: DICOM commit, v0.3.3 (was in old CHANGELOG but not in git)

## Lessons Learned
- Always increment version numbers, even for small changes
- Use "babysteps" versioning (v0.0.1 → v0.0.2 → v0.0.3)
- Check git history before committing to avoid duplicates
- Night shift commits need extra attention to versioning
