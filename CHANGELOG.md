# CHANGELOG v0.8.14

## [0.8.14] - 2025-07-03 - System Fields for Mapping Editor - Session 116

### Added
- **System Fields** in DicomConverter for flexible DICOM mapping:
  - `ConversionDateTime`, `ConversionDate`, `ConversionTime` - For when camera date is unreliable
  - `MachineName`, `UserName`, `UserDomainName` - System information
  - `PipelineName` - Current pipeline identification
  - `CamBridgeVersion`, `StationName`, `InstitutionName`, `InstitutionDepartment` - Installation info
  - `CaptureAge`, `CaptureAgeHours` - Calculated time since capture
  - `SourceFileName`, `SourceFileSize`, `SourceFileExtension` - File metadata
- Pipeline name parameter to DicomConverter constructor
- Pipeline name propagation from PipelineManager to DicomConverter

### Fixed
- StudyDate inconsistency in CreateSourceDataDictionary - now uses CaptureDateTime consistently
- DicomConverter now receives proper pipeline context for System Fields

### Changed
- DicomConverter constructor enhanced with optional pipelineName parameter

## [0.8.12] - 2025-07-03 - Session 114

### üîç Discovered
- **PACS Upload Black Hole**: After "Starting C-STORE" no success/failure/timeout logs appear - critical for production monitoring
- **DateTime Transform Issue**: CaptureDateTime format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" fails DICOM validation for DA/TM tags

### üìö Documentation
- **Consolidated all WISDOM documents**: Merged delta files from Sessions 94-113 into main documents
  - WISDOM_CLAUDE.md: Enhanced with Sessions 96-110 journey (40% ‚Üí 100% success rate)
  - WISDOM_TECHNICAL_PATTERNS.md: Added 10 new patterns including Service Restart Loop
  - WISDOM_META.md: Updated navigation paths and black hole discoveries
  - WISDOM_TECHNICAL_APIS.md: Added internal API changes (LogContext, Enums)
  - WISDOM_TECHNICAL_FIXES.md: Added 15+ new fixes including empty string trap
  - WISDOM_DEBT.md: Updated with critical Backup/Delete race condition
- **Created SESSION_115_HANDOVER.md**: Comprehensive start prompt with personality activation
- **Updated SPRINT_FIXES_SESSION_114.md**: Added concrete investigation points, expected logs, and test reproduction steps

### üêõ Known Issues (Prioritized)
1. **PACS Upload Logging**: Missing success/failure/timeout logs after C-STORE attempt
2. **DateTime Validation**: MappingRule.ApplyTransform() doesn't handle YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format
3. **Backup/Delete Race**: Potential data loss when Archive+Delete configured
4. **Monster ViewModels**: LogViewerViewModel (1543 LOC!), PipelineConfigViewModel (1400+ LOC)

### üéØ Next Session Focus
- Fix PACS upload logging black hole (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Implement DateTime transform for 14-digit format
- DataGrid multi-selection copy (if time)

### Internal
- Success Rate: Maintained 100% Sources First approach
- Documentation: 6 WISDOM files consolidated from ~15 delta files
- Code Quality: Identified service extraction needs for monster ViewModels

## [0.8.11] - 2025-01-02 - Session 111 - "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back"

### Changed
- LogViewer: Reverted to minimal DataGrid implementation after TreeView complexity explosion üò¢
- LogViewer: Removed ambitious hierarchical correlation view (for now)
- DicomConverter: Removed private tag for barcode data that nobody needed anyway

### Fixed
- Build errors from missing converters and invalid bindings
- DICOM conversion failing due to private tag VR issues
- LogViewer actually displays logs again (flat, but functional)

### Known Issues
- DataGrid selection/copy only works for single rows
- TreeView correlation display temporarily disabled
- Mapping configuration loads from wrong source (mappings.json instead of pipeline config)
- LogViewerViewModel is a 1543-line monster that needs urgent refactoring

### Technical Debt Added
- Abandoned sophisticated TreeView implementation
- Lost correlation hierarchy visualization
- LogViewer back to basic functionality

### Wisdom Gained
- Sometimes "minimal" is better than "broken"
- Monster ViewModels don't fit in AI chat windows
- Test complex UI changes incrementally
- The road to TreeView is paved with good intentions

## [0.7.32] - 2025-06-23

### üîß Fixed
- **ProcessingQueue retry spam** - FileSystemWatcher duplicate events now properly filtered
  - HashSet tracking was already implemented, just not obvious
  - Prevents "Source file not found" errors 80 seconds after successful processing
- **EXIF Barcode extraction** - Now correctly reads "RMETA:Barcode" prefix from ExifTool -G1 output
  - Checks both "RMETA:Barcode" and "Barcode" keys
  - Patient/Study data successfully extracted from Ricoh camera
- **DICOM 0x0 pixel dimensions** - Fixed multiple property name mismatches
  - ImageTechnicalData uses `ImageWidth` not `Width`
  - ExifTool returns "File:ImageWidth" with prefix
  - All dimension properties now correctly mapped
- **JSON number parsing** - ExifTool JSON output with numeric values now handled
  - Added proper JsonValueKind handling for all types
- **DI registration** - ExifToolReader now registered with config path from settings

### üéØ Changed
- **UTF-8 implementation** - Removed all encoding workarounds, clean UTF-8 throughout
- **Method names** - Verified all actual method signatures match usage
  - `ExtractMetadataAsync()` not `ExtractDataAsync()`
  - `ProcessAsync()` with `ProcessQueueAsync()` wrapper
- **Error messages** - More descriptive logging for EXIF extraction failures

### üìä Technical Details
- **Session 87**: 95 minutes of debugging, mostly property name issues
- **Root cause**: Not checking exact property names and EXIF output format
- **Solution complexity**: Most fixes were one-line changes
- **DICOM pipeline**: Now fully functional end-to-end! üéâ

### üí° Lessons Learned
- Property names must match EXACTLY (45 minutes on this alone!)
- ExifTool -G1 flag adds group prefixes to all keys

- "Sources first" would have saved 80% of debug time

### üöÄ Status
- **JPEG ‚Üí DICOM pipeline**: ‚úÖ Complete and working
- **Metadata extraction**: ‚úÖ All fields correctly parsed
- **Viewer compatibility**: ‚úÖ MicroDicom opens files
- **Remaining**: UTF-8 encoding verification with real camera

*"From property hell to DICOM success - Session 87"*

## [0.7.31] - 2025-06-23

### üéâ DICOM Pipeline Complete!
**Major Milestone**: JPEG to DICOM conversion pipeline fully functional with DICOM viewers!

### üîß Fixed
- **JPEG Encapsulation with undefined length** ‚≠ê - The critical fix!
  - Dataset must be created WITH transfer syntax: `new DicomDataset(DicomTransferSyntax.JPEGProcess1)`
  - fo-dicom now automatically uses undefined length (0xFFFFFFFF) for pixel data
  - Fixed "explicit length not permitted in compressed Transfer Syntax" error
- **Transfer Syntax location** - Now correctly set on FileMetaInfo, not Dataset
  - `dicomFile.FileMetaInfo.TransferSyntax = DicomTransferSyntax.JPEGProcess1`
- **Photometric Interpretation** - Set to YBR_FULL_422 for JPEG compliance
- **Character Set** - Added ISO_IR 192 for UTF-8 support
- **File Meta Information** - All required tags now properly populated

### ‚úÖ Verified
- **MicroDicom** - Opens DICOM files and displays images correctly!
- **dcmdump validation** - Shows proper undefined length pixel data
- **File structure** - Compliant with DICOM PS3.10 standard
- **Compression** - JPEG data properly encapsulated

### üìä Technical Achievement
```
dcmdump output confirms:
(0002,0010) UI =JPEGBaseline                    # Transfer Syntax ‚úÖ
(0008,0005) CS [ISO_IR 192]                    # UTF-8 Support ‚úÖ
(0028,0004) CS [YBR_FULL_422]                  # JPEG Photometric ‚úÖ
(7fe0,0010) OB (PixelSequence #=2)             # u/l ‚Üê Undefined Length! ‚úÖ
```

### üêõ Known Issues
- Character encoding shows "R‚îú√Çntgen‚î¨√°Thorax" (awaiting real camera test)
- Post-processing race condition (temporary workaround: SuccessAction="Leave")

### üí° Key Discovery
Creating a DicomDataset WITHOUT specifying the transfer syntax results in explicit length pixel data, which violates DICOM standard for compressed images. The entire fix was changing one line:
```csharp
// OLD: var dataset = new DicomDataset();
// NEW: var dataset = new DicomDataset(DicomTransferSyntax.JPEGProcess1);
```

### üèÜ Session 86 Summary
- **Duration**: ~3 hours of focused debugging
- **Tools**: dcmdump was invaluable for finding the real issue
- **Result**: Complete DICOM pipeline success!
- **Next**: C-STORE implementation for PACS upload

copy test.jpg C:\CamBridge\Watch\Radiology\
Start-Sleep -Seconds 10
$dcm = Get-ChildItem C:\CamBridge\Output -Filter *.dcm -Recurse | Select -First 1
Write-Host "DICOM created: $($dcm.FullName)"
# Open in MicroDicom - image should display correctly!
```

### Developer Notes
- Session 85: 3-hour debugging marathon with 5 major fixes

*"Making DICOM strictly compliant, one validation error at a time!"*  
¬© 2025 Claude's Improbably Reliable Software Solutions

## [0.7.29] - 2025-06-22

### üéâ DICOM Pipeline Finally Working!

### Added
- **Default metadata creation** - DICOM files created even without barcode/EXIF data
- **Comprehensive path logging** - All paths shown as absolute for debugging
- **Fallback to ArchiveFolder** - When OutputPath not configured in WatchSettings
- **ImageMetadata factory method** - CreateDefaultMetadata for resilient processing

### Fixed
- **Critical path bug** - DICOM files were created with relative paths, now always absolute
- **FilePattern property** - Fixed singular vs plural mismatch (FilePattern not FilePatterns)
- **Missing metadata handling** - No longer fails when EXIF extraction returns null
- **Domain object construction** - Proper use of immutable constructors for PatientInfo/StudyInfo

### Changed
- **FileProcessor** - Now returns absolute paths from DetermineOutputPath
- **DicomConverter** - Uses Secondary Capture SOP Class (more appropriate for converted images)
- **Post-processing** - Separated JPEG archival from DICOM output handling
- **Error resilience** - Pipeline continues even with minimal metadata

### Known Issues
- **Image quality** - DICOM shows noise/static due to incorrect Transfer Syntax
  - Current: Explicit VR Little Endian (uncompressed)
  - Should be: JPEG Baseline (compressed)
- **Character encoding** - German umlauts show as "?" in DICOM tags
- **Configuration mismatch** - UI shows OutputPath, service uses ArchiveFolder

### Technical Details
- DICOM files successfully created: ~100KB compressed JPEGs
- Metadata correctly extracted from Ricoh barcode format
- Pipeline processes: Watch ‚Üí EXIF ‚Üí DICOM ‚Üí Output/Archive
- Tested with DICOM viewer (MicroDicom) - files are valid

### Developer Notes
- Hardcoded DICOM tags work alongside custom mappings
- Service working directory affects relative paths
- Next sprint: Fix Transfer Syntax for proper image display

### Planned Implementation
1. Add ConfigurationPaths to Config UI startup (App.xaml.cs)
2. Migrate JSON files to unified V2 format
3. Update Service to use "CamBridge" section
4. Remove ParseServiceFormat workaround
5. Test Debug vs Release consistency

### Code Changes Prepared
- **App.xaml.cs** - Added ConfigurationPaths.InitializePrimaryConfig()

- Oliver: "ein nachvollziehbarer klarer, vern√ºnftiger weg f√ºr die zukunft"
- Solution: Unity through ConfigurationPaths and consistent format
- KISS: One config format for all modes and components
- Next: Implement and test with Tab-Complete system

### Technical Debt Identified
- Multiple incompatible config formats
- Missing centralized path management
- Workarounds (ParseServiceFormat) instead of fixes
- Different behavior in Debug vs Release

## Lessons Learned
- Always increment version numbers, even for small changes
