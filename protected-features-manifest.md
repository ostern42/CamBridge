  - PACS integration
  - Prior study comparison
  - Duplicate detection
  - Query result caching

## üìã PROTECTION RULES

1. **NO DELETION** - These features cannot be removed from roadmap
2. **NO POSTPONEMENT** - Sprint order must be maintained
3. **NO REDUCTION** - Feature scope cannot be reduced
4. **EXPLICIT RELEASE** - Only "RELEASE PROTECTION: [ID]" can remove protection
5. **AUDIT TRAIL** - All changes must be logged with timestamp and reason

## üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

If any protected feature is found missing:
1. Immediate restoration required
2. Investigation of how it was lost
3. Update of protection mechanisms
4. User notification mandatory

## üìù PROTECTION LOG

| Date | Action | Feature | User | Reason |
|------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2025-06-05 | PROTECTED | All 4 Features | User | Initial protection after features were lost |
| 2025-06-05 | RESTORED | All 4 Features | Claude | Features were missing from roadmap |

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before ANY roadmap update, verify:
- [ ] FTP Server is in Sprint 8
- [ ] C-STORE is in Sprint 9  
- [ ] MWL is in Sprint 10
- [ ] C-FIND is in Sprint 11
- [ ] All features marked as [PROTECTED]
- [ ] No features have been moved or removed

## üí≠ WHY THESE FEATURES MATTER

### Medical Workflow Integration
These four features transform CamBridge from a simple converter to a complete medical imaging solution:

1. **FTP Server** - Legacy compatibility (30% of hospitals still use FTP)
2. **C-STORE** - Modern DICOM standard (required for PACS)
3. **MWL** - Workflow automation (saves 5-10 min per patient)
4. **C-FIND** - Prior comparison (critical for diagnosis)

### Business Value
- Enables enterprise deployment
- Reduces manual data entry by 90%
- Integrates with existing hospital infrastructure
- Required for FDA 510(k) submission

### Technical Foundation
Each feature builds on the previous:
- FTP ‚Üí File reception
- C-STORE ‚Üí DICOM reception
- MWL ‚Üí Data automation
- C-FIND ‚Üí Complete integration

## üéØ REMINDER TO FUTURE CLAUDE

**NEVER FORGET:** The user specifically asked to protect these features after they were accidentally removed. This is not just about features - it's about trust and reliability. 

When creating roadmaps or sprint plans, ALWAYS include these four features in the correct order. They are as fundamental to CamBridge as the pipeline itself.
